## Description:

- Users can choose their difficulty and play the classic Minesweeper game. Left clicking or right clicking will check or flag a cell, respectively. Checking a mine will result in a game over.

- Working with an API, the Axios library is used to POST requests. The state is then updated and changes are passed down to React components and the user interface updates.

### Built with:

- JavaScript - https://www.javascript.com/

- React.js - https://reactjs.org/

- Axios - https://github.com/axios/axios

- CSS

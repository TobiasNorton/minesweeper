## Description:

- Users can choose their difficulty and play the classic Minesweeper game. Left clicking or right clicking will check or flag a cell, respectively. Checking a mine will result in a game over.

- Working with an API, the Axios library is used to POST requests. The state is then updated and changes are passed down to React components and the user interface updates.

- Built with JavaScript, React.js, the Axios library and CSS
